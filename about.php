        Hello, I'm Eric! I'm a software engineer from New Jersey. Welcome to my digital garden for my
        projects, recipes, ponderings, and varied musings I'd like to share. Check out the PROJECTS page for highlights
        of my public work, and the various BLOG pages for recipes and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          My site will forever be free from ads, tracking, or analytics. My sole purpose behind TACOS ON MARS is to contribute
          positively to my life and the internet, even if it's just this small little garden on a server somewhere.
        </p>

        The content of the website is maintained mostly for my personal use. I 
        quite enjoyed the technical or creative writing I was assigned throughout 
        college, and as such the blog section may be a nice way to research and 
        document some cool stuff I decide to write about from time to time. The 
        recipe section, while not quite original, is simply for storing and 
        referencing my personal creations, and being able to send them to family 
        and friends when they ask. Lastly, the best way to learn something is to 
        teach it, likewise the programming section may include programming subjects 
        I have found enough interest or value in to exercise my creative writing 
        ability on technical topics I am attempting to teach myself.
